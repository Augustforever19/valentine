            Happy Valentine's Day love!!
            <br><br>
            I can't express how happy I felt while making this for you and I hope you can feel the same warmth while reading this. 3rd year huh? We are going strong aren't we, moment by moment, day by day. I can not think of a moment our love has not been able to suprise me till today. Even today when I am not holding your hand you still live in my thoughts wrapped around my arms as I hug you tighter. 
            <br><br>
            To me, you are my soulmate someone who brings happiness no matter where she is through your honesty, love, care & affection. To be loved by you every day is what a man could only ask for and I am grateful I have you by my side. Cheers to us, our relationship, our love, our madness.
            <br><br>
            Yours Always, Vaibhav
